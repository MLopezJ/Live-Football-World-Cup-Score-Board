# Application decision records

This folder contains the application decision records (APPDRs) for this project.

The idea of this folder is to document the decision making related to the application, similar than the architecture decision records (ADRs) folder.

To know more about ADRs, see
[Documenting architecture decisions](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
and the video on
[Communicating and documenting architectural decisions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwfXkSjFhzc).
