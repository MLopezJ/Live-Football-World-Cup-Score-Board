# ADR 008: Use of Facade

With the intention of provide a simple library interface, the `facade` structural design pattern was implemented.

You can check its implementation in [README](../README.md#example-of-usage), [../src/example.ts](../src/example.ts) and [../src/index.spec.ts](../src/index.spec.ts).
